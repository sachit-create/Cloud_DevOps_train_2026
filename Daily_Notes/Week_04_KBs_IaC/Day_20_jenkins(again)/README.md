# Day 20 - Jenkins Revisit Summary

## What I Practiced

- Focused on re-running and validating CI/CD setup steps.
- Continued preparation for full-stack pipeline tasks in later days.

## Key Commands Used
- `git --version`
- `docker --version`
- `docker ps`

## Jenkinsfile Focus
- Created/updated a basic Jenkins pipeline with clear stages:
  - Checkout
  - Build
  - Test
  - Deploy

## Outcome

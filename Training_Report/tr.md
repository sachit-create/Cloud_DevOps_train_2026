## 5. Introduction

This report documents practical training progress in DevOps and Cloud Computing from Day 01 to Day 16. The training started with Linux and command-line fundamentals, moved to Git and GitLab workflow, continued with Maven/Gradle and containerization using Docker, and then progressed to AWS deployment fundamentals including EC2, RDS, and S3.

The primary focus of the training was hands-on implementation. Every day included practical activities, command execution, troubleshooting, and environment setup tasks that improved technical confidence for real deployment workflows.

---

## 6. Objectives

- Understand Linux system usage and command-line operations.
- Learn version control and branch workflow using Git and GitLab.
- Perform Java project build/test lifecycle using Maven and Gradle.
- Containerize applications and work with Docker images, containers, and networks.
- Practice AWS fundamentals for compute, storage, and database services.
- Build deployment-oriented thinking through day-wise practical exercises.

# CandDevOps Training Roadmap
Last Updated: February 24, 2026

## Current Position
- Training notes are present from `Day_01` to `Day_24`.
- Week 1 to Week 3 mostly use `notes.md`; Day 17 onward includes `work.md`/`README.md` in several folders.
- Week 4 folders and practice entries are available (`Day_19` to `Day_24`).
- Admin references are actively maintained (`tools.md`, `Work_Log.md`).
- Projects currently include:
  - `Projects/flask_docker_app`
  - `Projects/Node_project`

## Completed Milestones
- Week 1 (`Week_01_Linux_Git`): Linux, CLI, Git/GitLab basics, starter project artifacts.
- Week 2 (`Week_02_Docker_AWS`): Java/Maven, Docker fundamentals, container workflow, AWS intro.
- Week 3 (`Week_03_AWS_jenkins`): AWS deployment topics plus Jenkins/pipeline start (`Day_17`, `Day_18`).
- Week 4 (`Week_04_KBs_IaC`) in progress: GitLab/Jenkins revisit, pipelining, Kubernetes, Minikube (`Day_19` to `Day_24`).

## Active Milestones
- Standardize `Day_17` to `Day_24` note format (prefer one primary file pattern).
- Improve consistency of folder naming (remove special characters where possible).
- Week 5 (`Week_05_Project`): finalize project scope and execution plan.

## Next Actions
1. Normalize Week 3/4 entries to a consistent format (`notes.md` or `work.md`, choose one standard).
2. Add concise summaries for `Day_18` to `Day_24` to match Day 17 style.
3. Add/clean README for both projects (`flask_docker_app`, `Node_project`) with setup and run commands.
4. Define Week 5 deliverables: architecture, CI/CD flow, deployment target, and demo checklist.
5. Commit documentation and project updates in separate focused commits.

## Git Commit Plan
1. `Daily_Notes`: Week 3/4 note-format standardization and summary improvements.
2. `Projects`: README and run-instructions updates for Flask and Node projects.
3. `Admin_&_References` + `ROADMAP.md`: status tracking and planning updates.

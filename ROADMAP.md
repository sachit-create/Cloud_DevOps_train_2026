## Roadmap Action Closure

3. Project documentation (`flask_docker_app`, `Node_project`):
   - Completed with dedicated project `README.md` files.
4. Week 5 deliverable definition:
   - Completed with documented architecture, deployment, and presentation flow.
5. Admin and tracking updates:

## Final Repository State

- Daily notes are organized week-wise and day-wise.
- CI/CD reference documentation is available in `CI_CD/`.
- Project directories include runnable instructions.
- Report directory was intentionally cleared for fresh report recreation.

## Post-Training Maintenance (Optional)

1. Add future revision notes only under `Daily_Notes/Week_05_Project/`.
2. Keep `Admin_&_References/Work_Log.md` updated for interviews and portfolio tracking.
3. Recreate `Training_Report/` content when final submission format is decided.

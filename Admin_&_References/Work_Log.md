# Work Log

Last Updated: February 24, 2026

## Objective

Maintain a clear record of what I completed, what is pending, and what to improve in Cloud + DevOps training.

## Current Status

- `Daily_Notes` organized and renamed consistently for Week 1, Week 2, Week 3.
- Week notes cleaned so command content is merged into `notes.md`.
- Project folder improved:
  - `Projects/python_flask_project` renamed to `Projects/flask_docker_app`
  - project structure cleaned and ignore rules corrected for GitHub push.
- Admin references improved:
  - `tools.md` structured with links, checks, and common fixes.
  - attendance sheet formatted without changing attendance values.
- Revalidated repo objective and aligned admin docs to Cloud + DevOps training documentation needs.

## Weekly Progress Summary

### Week 1: Linux + Git Foundations

- Learned Linux basics, CLI practice, Git/GitLab basics, and intro CI/CD flow.
- Added day-wise notes and basic project artifacts.

### Week 2: Git + CI/CD + Docker + AWS Intro

- Continued with Docker/container topics and AWS fundamentals.
- Maintained notes for each day and organized screenshots and day folders.

### Week 3: AWS Deployment Practice

- Worked on EC2 + Apache and AWS deployment-related tasks.
- Notes and folder names normalized for consistency.

## Active Action Plan

- [ ] Push `flask_docker_app` in a clean commit.
- [ ] Stage and commit notes reorganization in a separate commit.
- [ ] Fill missing notes for empty days (for example `Day_06_Git_Branching`, `Day_17`).
- [ ] Add one mini-project README with setup and run steps.
